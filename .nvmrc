v20.3.1

<!-- If you want to make sure this version of Node.js is used every time you work on your project, you can create a .nvmrc file in your project root directory:

Type in terminal:
node -v > .nvmrc

After this, when you navigate to the project directory, you can simply type nvm use to switch to the version specified in the .nvmrc file. -->
